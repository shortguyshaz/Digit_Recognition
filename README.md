# Digit_Recognition

I created a neural network with Keras using the TensoFlow backend to classify handwritten digits and used this tutorial as reference:
https://www.sitepoint.com/keras-digit-recognition-tutorial/

it is an implementation of the Keras MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification model with an accuracy of 99%.
